In the Bloch-wave approach to estimate the baryon-number-violating scattering cross section in the standard electroweak theory in the laboratory, we clarify the relation between the single sphaleron barrier and multiple (near periodic) sphaleron barrier cases. We explain how a realistic consideration modifies/corrects the idealized Bloch wave and the resonant tunneling approximation. The basic approach is in part analogous to the well-known triple-Î± process to form carbon in nucleosynthesis.
