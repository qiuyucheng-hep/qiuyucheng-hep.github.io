The $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model provides an excellent fit to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. However, a statistically significant tension emerges when its determination of the Hubble constant $H_0$ is compared to the local distance-redshift measurements. The axi-Higgs model, which couples an ultralight axion to the Higgs field, offers a specific variation of the $\Lambda$CDM model. It relaxes the $H_0$ tension as well as explains the Li${}^7$ puzzle in big bang nucleosynthesis, the clustering $S_8$ tension with the weak-lensing (WL) data, and the observed isotropic cosmic birefringence in CMB. In this Letter, we demonstrate how the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions can be relaxed simultaneously, by correlating the axion impacts on the early and late universe. In a benchmark scenario ($m=2\times 10^{-30}$ eV) selected for upcoming experimental tests, the analysis combining the CMB+BAO (baryon acoustic oscillation)+WL+SN data yields $H_0=69.9 \pm 1.5$ km/s/Mpc and $S_8 = 0.8045 \pm 0.0096$. Combining this [excluding the SN (supernovae) part] with the local distance-redshift measurements yields $H_0=72.42 \pm 0.76$ km/s/Mpc, while $S_8$ is slightly more suppressed.
