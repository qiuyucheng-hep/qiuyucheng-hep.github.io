Guided by the naturalness criterion for an exponentially small cosmological constant, we present a string theory motivated 4-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ non-linear supergravity model (or its linear version with a nilpotent superfield) with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The model encompasses the minimal supersymmetric standard model, the racetrack KÃ¤hler uplift, and the KKLT anti-D3-branes, and use the nilpotent superfield to project out the undesirable interaction terms as well as the unwanted degrees of freedom to end up with the standard model (not the supersymmetric version) of strong and electroweak interactions.
