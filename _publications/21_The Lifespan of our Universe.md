The Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) measurements claim that the dark energy equation of state $w \ne -1$. This observation can be explained by the axion Dark Energy (aDE) model of an ultralight axion plus a cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Despite a relatively large degeneracy, there is a high probability that $\Lambda <0$. This negative $\Lambda$ leads the universe to end in a big crunch. Using the best-fit values of the model as a benchmark, we find the lifespan of our universe to be 33 billion years.
