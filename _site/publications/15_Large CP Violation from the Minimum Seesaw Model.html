<p>The minimum seesaw model with two right-handed neutrinos is considered, where the lightest neutrino is naturally massless. Instead of adopting texture zeros in the lepton Yukawa matrices, which cause both theoretical and experimental troubles, here we propose two-$\boldsymbol\epsilon$ textures, where $\boldsymbol\epsilon$ is a small number. Combined with neutrino oscillation experimental data, we find that a large CP angle is preferred for the normal neutrino mass order. In contrast, the CP angle almost vanishes for the inverted order. This can be well-tested in near-future experiments, such as Hyper-Kamiokande. Besides, the predicted effective Majorana neutrino mass $m_{ee}$ and the total neutrino mass $\sum m^\nu_i$ are also within reach of ongoing or future experiments.</p>
