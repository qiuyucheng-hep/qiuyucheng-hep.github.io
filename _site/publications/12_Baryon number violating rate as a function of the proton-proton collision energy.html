<p>The baryon-number violation (BV) happens in the standard electroweak model. According to the Bloch-wave picture, the BV event rate shall be significantly enhanced when the proton-proton collision center of mass (COM) energy goes beyond the sphaleron barrier height $E_{\rm sph}\simeq 9.0$ TeV. Here we compare the BV event rates at different COM energies, using the Bloch-wave band structure and the CT18 parton distribution function data, with the phase space suppression factor included. As an example, the BV cross section at 25 TeV is 4 orders of magnitude bigger than its cross section at 13 TeV. The probability of detection is further enhanced at higher energies since an event at higher energy will produce on average more same sign charged leptons.</p>
