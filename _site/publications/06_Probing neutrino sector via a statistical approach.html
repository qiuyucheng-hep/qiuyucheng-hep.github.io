<p>In this paper, we apply the idea of landscape (motivated by string theory) to study the statistical nature of parameters/couplings in the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions. Following the success of this approach on the fermion masses, we discuss the divergent behavior of the probability distributions of other physical parameters/couplings to obtain some insights on the quantities that cannot be measured by current experiments but can be relevant in cosmology, in particular those in the neutrino sector. From a relatively strongly mixed PMNS matrix, we argue that the probability distribution of heavy neutrino mass $P(M)$ does not diverge at $M = 0$. This analysis favors the degenerate heavy neutrino scenarios.</p>
