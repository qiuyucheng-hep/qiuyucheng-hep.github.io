<p>The electroweak axion is identified with the fuzzy dark matter of a mass $m\simeq 10^{-20}$â€“$10^{-19}$ eV. The model predicts two components of dark matter, one is ultralight and the other is WIMP-like. The Chern-Simons-type interaction between the fuzzy dark matter and photon and the $B+L$ breaking proton decays are predicted.</p>
